# Scripting Windows Host

Scripting Windows Host is a small scripting language created for Microsoft Windows.

With that scripting language you can automate system tasks that you may take some time like making a backup of your data, or simply to make your scripts for your own programs.

We're implementing some math functions, to let you use advanced math at your scripts, like calculating the float of a number, the square/cube, square/cube root, math exponents, pi, phi and e implementation.
The goal of Scripting Windows Host is to make another scripting language, very natural to people with english words, with also some simitudes with C and C++.


## Why use Scripting Windows Host?

Scripting Windows Host is really small compared to the amout of things you could do.
It's not the fastest, but as it's very simplified and you need a few lines, that small delay will be not very notable.
That doesn't mean that we aren't working at speed.
If you think that Scripting Windows Host isn't enought and you want more commands and functionalities, you can always import libraries with the command ``import [library].cmd``
That libraries will be special batch files that you could call to have some other things like WMIC usage or PowerShell script.

In future, library imports will be not that important, because we'll add some new things that will have the librearies.
For that, contribute to Scripting Windows Host to make it better!

But, to use it within library imports, contribute to the program to make it better!

### Scripting Windows Host Console

The console for Scripting Windows Host has more than 90 commands, including cryptography, string reversing, typical commands (creating folders and files and deleting them), network manipulation, and some other.

As Scripting Windows Host, it has been wrotten in Batch, VBScript, PowerShell (.NET objects) and some HTML, you don't require any other program to make it run correctly.
